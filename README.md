# web_portal
My first project.
I developed it based entirely on self-study of how to create web sites both on the front-end and back-end.
The project is designed to help technical services maintain reports in a single format. 
The project engine is built on a MySQL database. 
Navigation, menus, and project sections are included in the MySQL table format.
Output of pages to the browser and processing of user data are implemented in php scripts. 
The project uses Ayax and Jquery technology to access the database and output information to the browser in the background.
The project used an Apache server.
